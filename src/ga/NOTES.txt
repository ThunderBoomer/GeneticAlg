	THE CORRECT ASSIGNMENT OF AN ARRAY LIST TO A DECLARED ARRAY LIST VARIABLE -
		I just put an example of how Coupling will have to be changed when you set the global variable
		currentPopulation equal to the ArrayList that I send through setChroms
		
		No 'new' is needed, then you set the ArrayList variable directly equal to the incoming list.
