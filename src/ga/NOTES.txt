1)
	THE CORRECT ASSIGNMENT OF AN ARRAY LIST TO A DECLARED ARRAY LIST VARIABLE -
		I just put an example of how Coupling will have to be changed when you set the global variable
		currentPopulation equal to the ArrayList that I send through setChroms
		
		No 'new' is needed, then you set the ArrayList variable directly equal to the incoming list.

2)
	CODE HAS FEELINGS AS WELL -
		As the title states, the morale of a single line of code could dictate the outcome of the RUN.
		This quote: "so getChroms wouldn't feel left out" has proved to me that you not only know of
		this fact but also actively use it within programming. 
		
		Keep up the good work!

		P.S. I will post something that possesses a more ligitimate value asap.
